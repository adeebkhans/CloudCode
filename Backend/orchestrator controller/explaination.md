### **1. How Does `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com` Map to an IP Using Ingress?**
Yes, you’re correct that a domain (like `*.peetcode.com`) must point to an IP address, and **Ingress** plays a critical role in this process. Here’s how it works:app.post("/:username/:replId/start", async (req, res) => {
    const { username, replId } = req.params;
    const namespace = "default";

    try {
        const kubeManifests = readAndParseKubeYaml(
            path.join(__dirname, "../service.yaml"),
            username,
            replId
        );

        // Add the dynamically generated Ingress manifest
        kubeManifests.push(generateIngressYaml(username, replId));

        for (const manifest of kubeManifests) {
            switch (manifest.kind) {
                case "Deployment":
                    await appsV1Api.createNamespacedDeployment(namespace, manifest);
                    break;

                case "Service":
                    await coreV1Api.createNamespacedService(namespace, manifest);
                    break;

                case "Ingress":
                    await networkingV1Api.createNamespacedIngress(namespace, manifest);
                    break;

                default:
                    console.log(`Unsupported kind: ${manifest.kind}`);
            }
        }

        res.status(200).send({ message: "Resources created successfully" });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to create resources", error);
        res.status(500).send({ message: "Failed to create resources" });
    }
});


1. **DNS Wildcard Setup**:
   - The domain `*.peetcode.com` is configured with a **wildcard DNS record**.
   - A wildcard DNS entry looks like this:
     ```
     *.peetcode.com -> [Ingress Load Balancer IP]
     ```
   - This means any subdomain (`xyz.peetcode.com`, `abc.peetcode.com`, etc.) will resolve to the same IP—the **IP address of your Kubernetes Ingress Load Balancer**.

2. **Ingress Rules**:
   - Ingress in Kubernetes listens for incoming traffic on this Load Balancer IP.
   - It uses **host-based routing** to inspect the `Host` header of each request (e.g., `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`) and dynamically forward the request to the correct backend service.
   - In your case:
     - All WebSocket traffic (`ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`) is routed to the **runner service** in Kubernetes.

3. **Dynamic Mapping**:
   - The backend extracts `replId` from the subdomain (via the `Host` header).
   - Based on `replId`, it determines which pod (or repl environment) the request belongs to.
   - This dynamic mapping is achieved by maintaining a **routing database** or service that tracks which `replId` belongs to which pod.

### **2. How Does the Frontend Have Permission to Connect to This Domain?**
The frontend doesn’t “create” subdomains on the web magically, but the wildcard DNS and Ingress configuration make it *feel* like it does. Here’s why:

1. **Wildcard Subdomains**:
   - The wildcard DNS (`*.peetcode.com`) ensures that any subdomain (e.g., `xyz.peetcode.com`) resolves to the Ingress Load Balancer IP.
   - This works because the DNS record is **not tied to individual subdomains**. Instead, it routes all `*.peetcode.com` traffic to the same IP.

2. **Frontend Code**:
   - The frontend running locally (e.g., on `localhost:3000`) or in production doesn’t “create” subdomains. Instead, it **uses existing infrastructure** to connect to `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`.
   - When the frontend sends a WebSocket connection request to `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`, the following happens:
     - The request is resolved by the wildcard DNS to the Ingress IP.
     - The Ingress forwards the request to the appropriate backend service.

3. **Localhost Behavior**:
   - When running the frontend locally, it doesn’t matter where the frontend is hosted (`localhost`, a Vite dev server, etc.).
   - The key is that the **browser** can resolve `*.peetcode.com` via the wildcard DNS entry.
   - In production, this works seamlessly because the DNS is globally available. Locally, you’d need to ensure your machine can resolve `*.peetcode.com` (more on that below).

### **3. Does This Create Subdomains for Me on the Web?**
No, it doesn’t literally create subdomains for you, but it gives the illusion of creating subdomains because of how **wildcard DNS** works. Here’s why:

- **Wildcard DNS** doesn’t require you to predefine subdomains (e.g., `abc.peetcode.com`, `xyz.peetcode.com`). Instead, it resolves **any subdomain** under `*.peetcode.com` to the same IP address (Ingress Load Balancer).
- The **Ingress controller** then dynamically interprets the subdomain (via the `Host` header) and forwards the request appropriately.

For example:
- If your frontend sends a WebSocket request to `ws://abc.peetcode.com`, the DNS resolves it to the Ingress IP, and the Ingress forwards it to the backend service.
- The backend interprets `abc` as the `replId` and routes the request to the correct pod.

---

### **4. What About Local Development?**
In local development, things work slightly differently because your machine doesn’t automatically resolve `*.peetcode.com` subdomains. Here’s what happens:

#### **Frontend and Backend on Localhost**
1. **Frontend**:
   - If your frontend runs locally (e.g., via Vite on `localhost:3000`), it tries to connect to `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`.
   - However, your local machine doesn’t have DNS set up to resolve `*.peetcode.com` to an IP.

2. **Workaround**:
   - **Option 1: Modify `/etc/hosts`**:
     - Add an entry like this to your `/etc/hosts` file:
       ```
       127.0.0.1 replId.peetcode.com
       ```
     - This maps `replId.peetcode.com` to `localhost` for local testing.
   - **Option 2: Use Query Parameters Instead of Subdomains**:
     - During local development, modify the frontend to pass `replId` as a query parameter:
       ```javascript
       const newSocket = io(`ws://localhost:3001?replId=myRepl123`);
       ```
     - Update the backend to extract `replId` from `socket.handshake.query` instead of the `Host` header.

#### **Backend on Localhost**
- If the backend runs locally (e.g., on `localhost:3001`), it doesn’t rely on wildcard DNS or Ingress. Instead:
  - The frontend connects directly to `localhost:3001`.
  - The backend handles the WebSocket events as usual.

### **5. Connecting Frontend and Backend**
Here’s the full flow, whether running locally or in production:

#### **Production**
1. **Frontend**:
   - Hosted on `https://peetcode.com`.
   - Connects to WebSocket server at `ws://${replId}.peetcode.com`.

2. **Ingress**:
   - Routes WebSocket traffic from `*.peetcode.com` to the backend service.

3. **Backend**:
   - Extracts `replId` from the `Host` header and routes the connection to the appropriate pod.

4. **Runner Pods**:
   - Each pod handles an isolated repl environment.

---

#### **Local Development**
1. **Frontend**:
   - Hosted on `localhost:3000` (e.g., using Vite).
   - Connects to WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:3001` (with `replId` passed as a query parameter or via `Host` spoofing using `/etc/hosts`).

2. **Backend**:
   - Hosted on `localhost:3001`.
   - Handles WebSocket connections, extracts `replId`, and emulates pod routing.

3. **Runner (Optional)**:
   - For true isolation, use Docker to simulate runner pods locally.

---

### **6. Final Picture**
Here’s a **simplified diagram** of the flow:

#### **Production**
```plaintext
User Browser --> *.peetcode.com (DNS) --> Ingress (K8s) --> Backend --> Runner Pods
```

#### **Local Development**
```plaintext
Frontend (localhost:3000) --> Backend (localhost:3001) --> Runner (Docker/Simulated)
```

This approach ensures that both local and production setups follow similar patterns, with the main difference being how DNS and subdomain routing are handled.
